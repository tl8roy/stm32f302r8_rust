# STM32F302R8 using Rust
A template for using Rust on a STM32F302R8 (Nucleo)

When loaded onto the Nucleo board, the user LED will flash at 1Hz.

If there are problems flashing the board with cargo, update the onboard ST-Link firmware.
EG USB timeout error, the board not responding, weird GDB errors.
